# check-exception-owners: an exception the user can see is asked once, by
# name. Each of serves_page, text_presentation, host_content, stale, the link
# target and the reference bit is a fact a plugin or a source declares, and
# each has one predicate that turns it into the question the rest of the
# client asks. A bare field read outside that owner is a second derivation,
# and two derivations drift.
#
# Each line of scripts/exception-owners.txt is "<field regex> <owner path
# regex>", and the field may be read only in paths matching the regex. The
# scope is the client and the wire types it reads. A _test.go file is exempt,
# because a test may build any shape it likes, and so is
# client/wasm/testhook.go, which reports fields to the e2e harness and decides
# nothing. A comment is not a read, and neither is a "kind:" key in a
# composite literal: that tags an outgoing CreateTile or SetTile with the arm
# it wants. Only a comparison asks a question.
