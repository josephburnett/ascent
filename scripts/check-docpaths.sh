# check-docpaths: every repo path a doc or a comment names must exist. A path
# rots silently when code moves, and a stale one is a false fact about where
# something lives.
#
# The scope is every tracked *.md, *.go and *.ts, the go.mod and go.work
# files, and .github/workflows/*.yml. A token is path-like when it starts with
# a top-level directory and continues with path characters. A trailing `/` or
# `/...` is allowed, and trailing punctuation and a `.GoSymbol` suffix are
# stripped. A lowercase symbol suffix is not stripped, because `columns.go` is
# a file and `internal/cli.resolveBinary` is not; write that one as
# "resolveBinary in internal/cli".
#
# Exemptions go in scripts/docpaths-allow.txt as "<file> <path>" lines with a
# comment saying why the path is gone.
