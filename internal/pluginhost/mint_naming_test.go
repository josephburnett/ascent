// A grid keeps its name after its well is touched. The touch mints rows, the
// well's and its child grid's, but a row is storage and not a name: the next
// listing must still name the child grid by the address, and GetGrid must
// answer it under the id the well carries. A leaked row id makes the client
// cache the grid under the answered name and look it up forever under the asked
// one, a pane stuck on "loading" with nothing but 200s on the wire.
//
// It crosses the production seam because the two halves of the contract live on
// opposite sides: the adapter names the child grid, the client resolves a frame
// by that name.
