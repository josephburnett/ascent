// The web door's deadline rule: a Connect server stream held open through the
// WebDoorServer shape, over real HTTP, for longer than any deadline that shape
// declares, then proven live by an event after the hold. A declared timeout is
// a fact, and its test is a wait bound to its value. The web-door twin of
// door_deadline_test.go.
//
// net/http arms ReadHeaderTimeout to read the request headers and clears it
// once they are read, so an HTTP/1 response body streams on afterward; a
// WriteTimeout would deadline the whole response write and cut this stream.
// The hold is derived from WebDoorServer, so it tracks any deadline added to
// the shape. The wait is the test and must not be shortened by lowering the
// door's timeout.
