// dropTargetAt is the one owner of where a palette swatch may land, and it
// refuses a pane descended into a tile, because there is no grid on screen to
// drop into. The commit reads that same verdict through dropInputAt rather than
// resolving the destination again, so a release over a descended pane cannot
// create a tile in the grid hidden behind it. The two tests are a pair: the
// first pins that this gesture at this point does create a tile, so the second
// cannot pass by doing nothing.

// dropPoint is the top edge of the right pane, the farthest the cursor can get
// from the view center, where a content descent parks the tile it is inside. At
// a text descent's zoom a point near the center maps back to that tile's own
// cell, where an overlap check would refuse the drop for the wrong reason.
